            <h1>A more than green world</h1>
            <p>You have all heard, seen and imagined a green world. A world where nature would have almost more rights than humanity. If this is not the case, I will try to explain to you why we should not only imagine it but do it. </p>

            <h2>  What would be the goal</h2>
            <p>But why do it? You don't have the reference ? No problem. We almost all know it but the flora is our best ally against greenhouse gases. Yes, while we exhale CO2, they use it to breathe and we exhale air that we can breathe in. If we think briefly, actually we don't need to think. We need the flora but also the fauna to live as many things still.</p>

            <h2>  Give back what we have taken</h2>
            <p>TA green world would be to give more space to it to compensate the surplus of CO2 present in the air and especially in the cities. That's why we see mostly images imagined by architects on cities. Because it is the cities that need it the most. With the production of CO2 due to the use of vehicles for example.</p>

            <h2>  A small step, a big change</h2>
            <p>Of course, for this to work, you have to take one step at a time. That is to say, to leave room for nature but also to create less greenhouse effect. It remains now more than to realize it not. Again, not so simple in view of the economic policies of everyone and the importance of ecology at the moment. But I have hope that one day the thoughts and concepts of some people for this cause will become a reality.</p>
            <p>Besides, you can say that. But a world with lots of greenery will always be more beautiful than a world without, don't you think?</p>
