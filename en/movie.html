            <h1>A universal future</h1>
            <p>We have all imagined the future. We see ourselves in flying vehicles, in cities with more improbable architectures than the others. But for others it is a more dystopian vision that comes to mind. Well, it is a bit the case in Ready Player One!</p>

            <h2>  A virtual world</h2>
            <p>A bit the case, yes! Indeed, in this film adapted from the novel Player One by Ernest Cline, we are plunged into a dystopian reality. A city in ebullition where an incalculable number of people agglutinate. But to compensate for this reality, people find themselves in a virtual world called Oasis. Imagined and created by James Haliday.</p>
            <p>But the latter dies, but leaves behind an Ester Egg. This Easter Egg then attracts the attention of many people and they all embark on this quest. The goal, find 3 keys. Wade Watts (aka Parzival) embarks on this quest with his friends. The primary goal was not to gain control of the Oasis but to protect the IOI IOI is a company that wants to get control of the Oasis and become the first wealth in the world.</p>

            <h2>  A specific technique</h2>
            <p>To create this film and this universe, Steven Spielberg uses a technique called Motion Captur. It allows to retranscribe the movements of a real character in a fictional universe like the Oasis. This technique allows to retranscribe better the expressions than the ones created artificially because they are real. This technique is more and more used as in The Midnight Sky or in another film of Steven Spielberg, Tintin and the Secret of the Unicorn.</p>

            <h2>  A real imagination</h2>
            <p>This film is of course purely imaginary. But could we imagine a life like the one imagined in Ready Player One? Everything is possible, virtual reality is making great progress if we look at Meta.</p>
