            <h1>Paris, a city on the move</h1>
            <p>Everyone knows <a href="">Paris</a>. World capital of fashion, culture and even gastronomy. There is no reason to believe that this position will change anytime soon.</p>

            <h2>  The change is now</h2>
            <p>When we talk about change, we talk about the future. Well, for the future of Paris we are promised beautiful things. An architect t-elle that <a href="">Vincent Callebaut</a> who imagines a Paris with green towers. Of course everyone can imagine that. Now it is necessary to succeed in realizing it.</p>
            <p>Several projects are nevertheless in progress to work in the way of a green and ecological city. The waterfront of the Seine has been for years underused. So a new plan to change that was created to change that. The aim was to integrate the river as best as possible by designing new parks, squares and pedestrian bridges.</p>

            <h2>  An Archi'Museum</h2>
            <p>Another project is under construction. It is scheduled to open in 2022. This project is a museum project dedicated to the famous fashion designer, Yves Saint Laurent. The museum will be located in the center of the Marais district to attract fashion lovers from all over the world.</p>

            <h2>  A bit complicated life</h2>
            <p>Although Paris is trying to keep its position, we should probably consider improving life in general. Create new transportation points that are more ecological, such as bicycles (electric or not), public transportation that is much less polluting. It might even be time to expand the areas where vehicles would no longer be accepted to really consider a more ecological future.</p>
            <p>Of course, once again, imagination takes over. But there is always the same problem. That of the economy.</p>
