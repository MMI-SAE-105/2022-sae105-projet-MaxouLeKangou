            <h1 class="article__content--title">More than just cartography</h1>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">We have all been fascinated by some things. Some of us have been fascinated by cooking, computers, ... While others were fascinated by cartography. In this book, we follow a young girl named Sophia. Orphaned, she lives with her uncle and follows his adventures with envy.</p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  A fantastic adventure</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">In 1799, each continent is plunged into different time periods, causing the creation of a new world completely turned upside down. About a century after this "Great Upheaval", we follow the adventures of Sophia, an orphaned child living with her uncle. Her uncle, Shadrack, is a famous cartographer from Boston. But he is going to be kidnapped! So Sophia sets out to find him with only one lead. A glass card is a message written by her uncle...</p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  A writer-historian</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">From the first pages of the novel, the writer <a href="https://www.babelio.com/auteur/SE-Grove/365158">S.E. GROVE</a> plunges us into a unique universe. She manages to mix adventure, travel, friendship, time jumping and even pirates in a single writing. At the moment, the author has only written 3 books which is neither more nor less than the trilogy The Cartographers.</p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  More than a simple map</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">In this novel, the maps are the element most appreciated by the readers because you will not see them anywhere else. Some are made of glass, steel, earth, ... and each has different functions. One can show places. Another can show smells, sensations, feelings, ... all at different times. It is even possible to assemble several cards to combine their functions.</p>
            
            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  A timeless traveler</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">S.E. GROVE has the advantage of being able to write these novels because of her background. This historian has traveled a lot. Especially in Latin America and the United States. On top of that, she lives in the Boston area. So one might wonder if her books are autobiographical. But unfortunately so much fantasy and magic does not exist in our world.</p>
