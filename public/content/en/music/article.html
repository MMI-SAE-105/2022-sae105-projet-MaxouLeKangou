            <h1 class="article__content--title">Multi-talented artist</h1>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">Back To You is one of the songs used in the soundtrack of 13 Reasons Why. The series is co-produced by the artist who wrote and sung this song. This artist is none other than <a href="https://www.selenagomez.com/">Selena Gomez.</a></p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  12 years and already talented</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">Selena Gomez was born in Grand Prairie, Texas. From an early age, she is interested in acting. She became known in the Disney Channel series, The Wizards of Waverly Place. Of course, she doesn't only act in children's series. Now 30 years old, she has been able to act in many series and movies such as Getaway (2013), The Fundamentals of Caring (2016) or even more recently the series Only Murders in the Building.</p>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">His talent does not stop there. Above all, her greatest talent is that of music. As said before, she sang for the soundtrack of her own series but she also has three albums to her credit. Her latest album dates back to 2020 with the famous song Lose You To Love Me, which reached number 1 on the Billboard 100 and was her first song to reach the top of the Billboard charts.</p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  An Archi'Museum</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">Another project is under construction. It is scheduled to open in 2022. This project is a museum project dedicated to the famous fashion designer, Yves Saint Laurent. The museum will be located in the center of the Marais district to attract fashion lovers from all over the world.</p>

            <h2 class="article__content--subtitle">  A reference for fashion too</h2>
            <p class="article__content--paragraph">So far I have only told you about her talent as an artist. But she doesn't stop there. At the same time she released her album Rare (2020), she also released a cosmetic brand called Rare Beauty. Her goal with this brand, is not to create a nth brand of "artist". For her, makeup should be used to feel good, without hiding what makes each person in this world unique. Cosmetics are numerous and so are the brands that go with them. Yet despite the competition, she managed to create a brand that people appreciate without even knowing Selena Gomez.</p>
